**Q1: What caught your attention in this video?**  
I found BJ Fogg’s approach to starting habits with very small actions fascinating—like flossing a single tooth or doing two pushups after brushing. It shows that big results don’t require big beginnings; small consistent steps lead to long-term habit formation.

**Q2: How can B = MAP help in forming habits? What do M, A, and P stand for?**  
B = MAP stands for **Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt**.  
- **M (Motivation):** How much I want to do the habit.  
- **A (Ability):** How easy or difficult it is to perform.  
- **P (Prompt):** A trigger to remind me to act.  

By making habits easy (high ability) and attaching them to clear prompts, I can maintain habits even if motivation is low.  

**Q3: Why is celebrating important after completing a habit?**  
Celebration reinforces positive emotions, making the habit enjoyable. BJ Fogg emphasizes that *“what you celebrate becomes a habit”*. Even small celebrations strengthen consistency.

**Q4: What concept stood out in this video?**  
The idea of incremental improvement resonated with me. Enhancing by just 1% daily might seem minor, but over time, it accumulates into substantial progress. Patience and steady effort yield long-term success.

**Q5: What does the book say about identity?**  
The book stresses that habits stick when they are part of our identity. Instead of thinking “I want to run a marathon,” I should think “I am a runner.” Aligning habits with identity ensures lasting behavior change.  

**Q6: How can habits be made easier?**  
Reduce friction to make habits simple. For instance, laying out exercise clothes beforehand makes workouts easier to start. Simpler actions increase the likelihood of following through.  

**Q7: How can bad habits be made harder?**  
Increase friction for undesirable habits. For example, uninstall distracting apps or store unhealthy snacks out of reach. Making it inconvenient reduces repetition.
