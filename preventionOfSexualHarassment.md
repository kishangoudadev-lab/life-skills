# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH)

## Questions & Answers

### 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment means any **unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature** that makes someone feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or humiliated. It is not limited to physical acts; it can also be verbal or non-verbal.  

Some common examples are:  
- **Unwanted physical contact**: touching, hugging, patting, pinching, or standing too close.  
- **Verbal harassment**: making sexual jokes, offensive comments, repeated requests for dates, or remarks on someone’s gender or appearance.  
- **Non-verbal behaviour**: staring, inappropriate gestures, showing offensive images, videos, or messages.  
- **Quid pro quo**: asking for sexual favours in return for promotions, pay hikes, or job security.  
- **Hostile environment**: repeated behaviour that creates fear, disrespect, or discomfort in the workplace.  

The [MountBlue PoSH Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wrT03caeDwwKB50wV-MQ3hnm2wJZGuq2/view?usp=sharing) and [training videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue3BTGW3uRQ) explain that even small but repeated acts can become harassment if they make the workplace unsafe or intimidating.

### 2. What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?

If I face harassment, my first step would be to **ensure my safety** by moving away from the situation. I would then **note down the details** — what happened, where, when, and who was involved.  

The next step is to **report the incident** to HR or the Internal Committee, as required by the [PoSH policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wrT03caeDwwKB50wV-MQ3hnm2wJZGuq2/view?usp=sharing). Reporting in writing and keeping a copy helps in case of further enquiry.  

If I witness harassment, I would **support the person affected**, encourage them to raise a complaint, and if needed, report it myself. The [scenario videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3FhoCz-FbA) show that bystanders play an important role in stopping harassment.  

If the issue is not resolved internally or if retaliation happens, I would **approach external legal authorities**. Everyone has the right to work in a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment.  

The [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7e2c6v1oDs) highlight that quick action, proper reporting, and support from colleagues are key to preventing repeated incidents.
