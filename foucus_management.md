Giving the brain time and space to experience *diffused mode* helps it rest and recharge.  
Activities that help:  
- Meditation  
- Walking without digital distractions

## 7. Getting Started on Difficult Tasks
Procrastination often comes from avoiding emotions like fear, boredom, or frustration.  
A common method: **“Action precedes motivation”**.  

**Steps:**  
1. Work only for 30 seconds on the task.  
2. Take a short break.  
3. Remind yourself: *“This task is hard/boring, but I am capable of finishing it.”*  
4. Repeat steps 1–3 and gradually increase work time.  

This builds small proofs of progress, which the brain uses to build confidence and shift identity from “avoiding” to “capable of finishing tasks.”
